# HEIF Forensic Test Files

This repository hosts the code used to generate unconventional test images for the research paper:
McKeown, S. & Russell, G. (In Press). Forensic Considerations for the High Efficiency Image File Format (HEIF). IEEE International Conference on Cyber Incident Response, Coordination, Containment & Control (Cyber Incident 2020)



# src
 
A bit of a stub, essentially contains some of the code used to generate files in /test\_images. This was achieved largely by copying and modifying existing examples in the Nokiatech HEIF library


# test\_images

Contains generated test images used in the experiments. /test\_images/DETAILS.MD specifies the content of each file.
